### About Me
- I'm a 17 year old student and developer from Illinois in the United States.
- I won Apple's [2020 WWDC Swift Student Challenge](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/swift-student-challenge/). Click [here](https://github.com/ifisq/Build-A-Piano) to take a look at my submission!
- I've done projects with Python, Java, Node.JS, Swift, and Objective-C.
- My projects have been used by over 1.7 million people (and counting!)

### Projects
- [TuneTrack](https://tunetrack.app) is an iOS application I built to help you track your music statistics on platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and Last.fm. It went viral in September 2020 and was the #1 music application on the App Store in over 40 countries, above apps like Spotify. It was also the #1 application on the entire App Store (above apps like TikTok, Facebook, and YouTube) in some countries like the UK and Mexico, and peaked at #6 in the United States.
- [Wonderbar](https://github.com/ifisq/Wonderbar), an iOS tweak that enables customization of the status bar.
- [Auroris Development](https://auroris.dev) is a business I started geared toward making tools for the sneaker community. 
- [Build A Piano](https://github.com/ifisq/Build-A-Piano) was my winning submission for the Apple Swift Student Challenge.
- Auroris Tools was a desktop application I built using Node.js and Electron. It included a browser spoofer, proxy tester, and Shopify account generator.
- Auroris SMS is a Discord bot I built to connect sneaker release information providers to their customers. It enables sending mass SMS messages via Discord, and was built using Python with MongoDB for holding customer information with the Twilio API used to send messages.
- [Spotify Widget](https://github.com/ifisq/spotify-widget) is a widget I made 2 days after iOS 14 was announced. This utilized the brand-new WidgetKit Framework to display your Spotify Now Playing song on your home screen, no matter where it's playing from!
- Coalesce Trivia was a service that utilized crowdsourcing to display and try to guess the correct answer for questions on the popular gameshow HQ Trivia. Coalesce got an average of 11 out of 12 questions right every single game!

### What am I working on?

- I'm currently working on TuneTrack and adding additional features to the application.
